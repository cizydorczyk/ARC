# Scripts for creating jobs on ARC.

This repository contains scripts (only one currently) for creating **FastQC**, **Trimmomatic**, **Unicycler**, and **SKESA** jobs for ARC. These can then be uploaded to ARC and submitted to run the desired analyses.

See the [Wiki](https://github.com/cizydorczyk/ARC/wiki) for current tutorials.
